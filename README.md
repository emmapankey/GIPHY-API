# GIPHY-API

Dynamic web page that populates chosen gifs using data provided by the GIPHY API

* An array of strings is saved to a topic variable.
* A button is created on the page for each index in the array.
* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. 
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif changes to it's animated state. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
* The rating for each GIF is displayed below it (PG, G, so on). 
* A form for user input adds new topics to the array.
